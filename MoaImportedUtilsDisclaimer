NOTE:

`com.moa.utils` has some files that were imported from Project Nexus. These classes are my IP, however the code is open sourced. 
Please be aware that repeat code was necessary for the making of this project.
If you have any concerns as to the validity of this module, please see my GitHub repository for ProjectNexus: https://github.com/PerceusAdalian/NexusPrime.
Thank you for your attention.
